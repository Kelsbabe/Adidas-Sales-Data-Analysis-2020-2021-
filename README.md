# Adidas-Sales-Data-Analysis-2020-2021-
This project presents an exploratory and business-driven analysis of Adidas sales data from 2020 to 2021. The objective is to uncover patterns, performance drivers, and behavioral insights that can support data-informed decision-making.  
The analysis focuses on seasonality, regional performance, product contribution, and sales channel behavior, with an emphasis on translating data into actionable business insights.

Business Questions Addressed

How does sales performance vary over time?

Are there identifiable seasonal demand patterns?

Which regions and states contribute most to revenue?

Which product categories drive performance, and which underperform?

How do sales channels compare in revenue contribution?

Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional retail sales records with the following dimensions:

Time (Year, Month)

Region, State, and City

Product Category and Product Type

Sales Channel (In-store, Online, Outlet)

Revenue, Units Sold, and Profit Metrics

Basic data validation and cleaning were performed prior to analysis.

Key Insights
1. Seasonality in Sales

Sales performance showed a clear seasonal pattern:

Highest revenue: July ($95M)

Lowest revenue: March ($57M)

This indicates structured demand behavior rather than random fluctuations, suggesting that forecasting models should incorporate seasonal components.

2. Regional Performance

The West region emerged as the top contributor with $270M in revenue, significantly outperforming other regions.

High-performing states included:

California

New York

Florida

This suggests that regional strategies and consumer behavior vary and should be analyzed independently.

3. Product Contribution

Product-level analysis revealed uneven performance:

Top performer: Men’s Street Footwear ($209M)

Lowest performer: Women’s Athletic Footwear ($11M)

This variance highlights opportunities for product repositioning, targeted marketing, or redesign rather than uniform investment across categories.

4. Sales Channel Insights

Despite the growth of e-commerce:

In-store sales generated the highest revenue

Online and outlet channels provided strong supplementary contributions

This confirms the continued relevance of physical retail while supporting an omnichannel strategy.
